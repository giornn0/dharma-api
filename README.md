# VanillaNodeJS
Like the title says, this is  a whole vanilla Nodejs API, for the moment can handle basic CRUD with
data like images. I was trying to maek something  with my bare hands, an this is what i kinda come with.
All casero haha, the validation with regexp, with a crafted validation function, the route  can be setted pretty easy
You have the section/id/relation or image
for the moment it gets the job done.
